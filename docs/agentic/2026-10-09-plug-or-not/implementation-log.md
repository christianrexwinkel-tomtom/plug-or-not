- **Mode:** slice-aware — Slice 1 (plan approved by the user 2026-10-12; plan status Draft → Approved)

## Pre-Flight

Filled once, before the first chunk. All checks must pass before dispatching the first worker.

### Test runner

```
$ ls package.json
ls: package.json: No such file or directory
(greenfield repo — no test runner yet; Task 1 creates package.json, Vitest and the `npm test` script)
$ node --version
v20.19.5
$ npm --version
11.14.0
```

### Build / lint / typecheck

```
$ npm view vite@8.3.4 version             -> 8.3.4
$ npm view vitest@5.0.3 version           -> 5.0.3
$ npm view typescript@7.0.2 version       -> 7.0.2
$ npm view tsx@4.23.15 version            -> 4.23.15
$ npm view @fontsource/sora@5.3.0 version -> 5.3.0
$ npm view @fontsource/ibm-plex-mono@5.3.0 version -> 5.3.0
$ npm view @types/node@22.20.5 version    -> 22.20.5
```

### External services / auth

```

### Pre-commit hooks

```
$ ls .pre-commit-config.yaml
ls: .pre-commit-config.yaml: No such file or directory
(no pre-commit config and no non-sample git hooks — nothing to run)
```

Result: ☑ all green

## Slice 1: Answer for my location (no map)

<!-- Chunk-workers append `### Chunk N: Tasks A–B` entries below, each with: Plan tasks covered, Tests written, Worker reported peak context, Worker status, Commit SHA(s), and a `#### Verify output (verbatim)` block. -->

<!-- Duplicate the Chunk N block above for each subsequent chunk.
     A new chunk starts only after the previous chunk is committed and its
     tasks' tests pass. The orchestrator tightens its remaining-chunk
     estimate from each chunk's reported peak; if a worker overflowed, the
     remainder was re-chunked smaller (record the re-chunk in the new
     Chunk N entry's "Plan tasks covered"). -->

## End-Review (Slice 1)

Filled once, after the LAST chunk commits. The reviewer reads the final committed diff + tests + acceptance criteria — never any worker's narrative.

- **Verdict:** {APPROVED | ISSUES_FOUND → fixed → re-reviewed → APPROVED | CAP_REACHED — round-2 findings fixed, not re-reviewed}
- **Issues found:** {list, or `None`}
- **Tests-vs-spec audit:** {do the tests verify the specified behavior, or were they shaped around the code? — explicit finding}
- **Reviewer rounds:** {N — one per reviewer dispatch, max 2; the initial review is round 1}
- **Cap outcome:** {`none` — the reviewer approved | round-2 findings fixed without a re-review: <findings verbatim> + <fix commit SHA(s)>, plus any finding deliberately left unfixed and disclosed}

<!-- hint: The 2-round cap is final — no third round and no user decision at
     the cap. When round 2 found issues, the verdict is
     `CAP_REACHED — round-2 findings fixed, not re-reviewed`, never a bare
     APPROVED: those last fixes are reviewer-unverified and must stay visible
     to later readers. -->

### Final full verify output (verbatim)

Verbatim stdout/stderr of the final full verify command over the whole change. Do NOT paraphrase.

## Deviations from Plan

| #   | Task/Chunk | Type (change/gap) | Description | Plan updated? | Status | Date |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ | ---- |
|     |            |                   |             |               |        |      |

<!-- If there are no deviations, write "None." below the table and confirm verbally with the user. -->

<!-- ============================================================ ## Slice N
     SLICES-MODE IMPLEMENTATION LOG STRUCTURE (commented reference)
     ============================================================
     When the plan being executed is slice-aware (the implement skill
     detected `^## Slice [0-9]` headers in plan.md), chunk entries are
     grouped under per-slice headers. Chunking happens INSIDE a slice's
     session over that slice's tasks, and the End-Review runs over that
     slice's diff (change-design Behavior 5). The per-chunk entry format
     (Plan tasks covered / Tests written / peak / SHAs / Verify output)
     is unchanged — only an extra grouping level is added.

     The Deviations from Plan table is shared across slices. When a row is
     slice-scoped, the slice ID is prefixed in the Description cell
     (e.g. `Slice 2: oversized — split into 2a/2b`).

     ----- Example shape -----

     ## Slice 1: <slice 1 name>

     ### Chunk 1: Tasks 1–3
     - Plan tasks covered: …
     - Verify output (verbatim): …

     ### End-Review (Slice 1)
     - Verdict: APPROVED
     - Tests-vs-spec audit: …

     ## Slice 2: <slice 2 name>
     ### Chunk 1: Tasks 4–6
     …
     ### End-Review (Slice 2)
     …

     ## Deviations from Plan
     (Shared across all slices. Slice ID prefixed in Description cell when
     slice-scoped, e.g. `Slice 2: …`.)
     ============================================================ -->
